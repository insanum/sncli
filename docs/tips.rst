Markdown Pager
**************

Set ``mdv`` as your pager for ``sncli`` and get a formatted view of your markdown files [Suggested by `s5unty`_]:

+ Install `mdv`_
+ Create a pager/wrapper

    .. code-block:: shell

        /usr/local/bin/mdless
        ---------------------
        #!/bin/zsh
        # https://superuser.com/questions/1059781/what-exactly-is-in-bash-and-in-zsh
        /usr/bin/less -R -c =(mdv "$1")

+ Make the reader an executable file

    .. code-block:: shell

        sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mdless

+ Now set ``mdless`` as your pager

    .. code-block:: shell

        $HOME/.snclirc
        ------------------------
        cfg_pager = /usr/local/bin/mdless

Note: MDV does not yet support using a light backdround

Vim, Auto-set filetype
**********************

Modeline
========

Add a modeline to each note, for `VimOutliner`_ you would add [Suggested by `insanum`_]:

.. code-block:: vim

    ; vim:ft=votl

This will change the file type for the note it's been added to.

AutoCommand
===========

You could also add an AutoCommand to your ``vimrc``:

.. code-block:: vim

    augroup sncli_ft
    au BufEnter,BufWrite,BufRead,BufNewFile /tmp/*.txt set filetype=asciidoc
    augroup END

This will set text files opened in sncli's default temp directory to the filetype of Asciidoc.

Open Links
**********

Find and open links faster with ``urlscan`` or ``urlview``.

+ Install `urlscan`_ or `urlview`_
+ Pipe the note from the note view
+ Select a link!
